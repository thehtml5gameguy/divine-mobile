## Project Notes

OpenVine bug reporting now uses file attachments instead of mailto: body text:

**Files Modified:**
- lib/config/bug_report_config.dart - Email address change
- lib/services/bug_report_service.dart - Complete rewrite of sendBugReportViaEmail()
- lib/widgets/bug_report_dialog.dart - Updated success message
- test/widgets/bug_report_dialog_test.dart - Updated all tests

**User Experience:**
- Web: Click "Send Report" → file downloads → user emails it manually
- iOS/macOS: Click "Send Report" → share sheet opens → user chooses Mail app
- Both show clear instructions to email to contact@divine.video

**Implementation Quality:**
- Clean platform abstraction with kIsWeb branching
- Proper error handling in both web and native paths
- Consistent with existing SharePlus usage patterns
- All tests passing, no new analyzer warnings
