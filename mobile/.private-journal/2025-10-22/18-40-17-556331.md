## Project Notes

**OpenVine Mobile Web Build Status**: The codebase is currently unbuildable for web due to numerous dart:io dependencies in:
- `lib/services/upload_manager.dart` - extensive File/Directory usage
- `lib/services/upload_initialization_helper.dart` - Directory operations
- `lib/screens/pure/video_metadata_screen_pure.dart` - File type mismatch

These would need platform-specific implementations to support web builds. The iOS/Android native builds likely work fine.
