## Project Notes

OpenVine mobile app had router migration from MainNavigationScreen to GoRouter-based nav. The migration deleted enterSearchMode() method from ExploreScreen. Stale build artifacts were causing crashes until flutter clean was run.

The app's search functionality is now router-driven via /search/:searchTerm routes handled by SearchScreenPure widget.
