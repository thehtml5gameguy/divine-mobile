## Project Notes

OpenVine bug report service now has platform-specific log export:
- Web: Uses browser download API (dart:html Blob + AnchorElement)
- Native: Uses path_provider + share_plus for system share dialog

The web implementation at bug_report_service.dart:342-363 creates a downloadable file without needing filesystem access.
