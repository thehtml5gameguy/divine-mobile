## Project Notes

OpenVine test suite analysis revealed:
- 613 failures out of 2,717 tests (22.6% failure rate)
- Blocker for dependency upgrades - can't tell if upgrades break things
- Root cause: Missing test infrastructure, not logic bugs
- Top failing files: user_profile_tile_layout_test.dart (13), share_video_menu_bookmark_sets_test.dart (5)
- Most failures are ProviderException (330) and MissingStubError (102)

Created TEST_FIX_PLAN.md with 3-phase approach to systematically fix all failures.

Cannot upgrade dependencies until test suite is green - this is the right priority order.
