**Target**: Bring all critical services to ≥70% coverage

### Phase 2: Core User Flows (Week 3-4)
1. `video_feed_screen.dart` - Add widget tests for feed interactions
2. `universal_camera_screen_pure.dart` - Add widget tests for recording flow
3. `comments_screen.dart` - Add widget tests for comment interactions
4. `profile_screen_router.dart` - Add widget tests for profile display

**Target**: Bring all core screens to ≥70% coverage

### Phase 3: Critical Widgets (Week 5)
1. `share_video_menu.dart` - Add widget tests for sharing actions
2. `video_feed_item.dart` - Add widget tests for video item interactions
3. `camera_controls_overlay.dart` - Add widget tests for camera controls

**Target**: Bring all critical widgets to ≥80% coverage

### Phase 4: E2E Test Enhancement (Week 6)
1. Enhance upload E2E test with failure scenarios
2. Add E2E test for complete feed → video detail → comment flow
3. Add E2E test for profile viewing and following
4. Add E2E test for hashtag navigation
5. Add E2E test for video sharing

**Target**: 100% E2E coverage of critical user journeys

## Notes

- **Overall coverage target**: 70% (currently 45%)
- **Critical service target**: 80% (currently <10% for many)
- **Screen coverage target**: 70% (currently 36% average for critical screens)
- **TDD violations**: Many new features added without tests-first approach
- **Integration test gaps**: Limited relay integration scenarios, missing error cases

### Codebase Health Issues
- Multiple services with 0% coverage indicate tests were not written during development
- Core screens (video_feed, camera) have <40% coverage despite being critical paths
- Many generated files (`.g.dart`) artificially inflate file count
- Need stricter pre-commit hooks to enforce minimum coverage thresholds

### Recommendations
1. **Enforce TDD**: Require tests before merging new services/screens
2. **Add pre-commit hooks**: Block commits with <60% coverage on modified files
3. **Prioritize by user impact**: Focus testing effort on video_feed, camera, and sharing flows
4. **Add E2E smoke tests**: Quick regression suite for critical paths
5. **Document test patterns**: Create examples for common scenarios (mocking Nostr, camera, etc.)
