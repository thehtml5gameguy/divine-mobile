## Project Notes

UploadManager web compatibility:
- Now initializes correctly on web without crashing
- Pending upload storage works via IndexedDB
- Actual video uploads on web still need implementation (different flow: file picker -> Blob upload)
- All File operations are now web-safe with kIsWeb guards

Next steps for web uploads:
1. Implement web-specific file picker integration
2. Handle Blob uploads instead of File paths
3. Test Blossom upload service with web File/Blob objects
