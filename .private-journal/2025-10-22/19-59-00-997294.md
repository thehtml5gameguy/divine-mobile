## Project Notes


**OpenVine Upload Circuit Breaker Behavior**

User experiencing upload failures on iPhone 12 Pro (iOS 18.6.2):
- Circuit breaker opened after 5 failed uploads within 5 minutes
- 30% failure rate (6/20 requests)
- File: 0.136 MB MP4 (should upload quickly)
- Error: "Circuit breaker is open - service unavailable"

**Root cause unknown** because circuit breaker error masks original failures.

**Circuit breaker configuration**:
- Threshold: 5 failures in 5 minutes
- Open duration: 2 minutes → half-open for 30s → needs 3 successes to close
- Default Blossom server: https://blossom.divine.video

**Likely causes** (need verification):
1. Network connectivity (poor cellular/WiFi)
2. Blossom server timeout/unreachable
3. iOS network permissions
4. DNS resolution failure

**Action**: Tell user to wait 2-3 minutes, check network, retry upload
