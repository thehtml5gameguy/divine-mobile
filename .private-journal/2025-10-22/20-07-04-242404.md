## Project Notes


**Upload Error Handling Improvements - Build 44+**

**User-facing improvements**:
- Users now see helpful messages like "No internet connection. Check your WiFi..." instead of "Exception: DioError..."
- Error messages include actionable advice
- Upload retries work properly (circuit breaker removed)

**Debugging improvements**:
- Crashlytics upload failure reports now include:
  - Network type (WiFi, Cellular, Offline)
  - Network status flags
  - Better error categorization (NO_INTERNET, SLOW_CONNECTION, TIMEOUT, DNS_ERROR, etc.)
  - User-friendly message alongside technical error

**Error categories**:
- NO_INTERNET: Device offline
- SLOW_CONNECTION: Timeout on cellular (suggest WiFi)
- TIMEOUT: Generic timeout
- NETWORK_ERROR: Network failure
- DNS_ERROR: Can't resolve domain
- FILE_TOO_LARGE: Video too big (413)
- AUTHENTICATION: Sign in again
- SERVER_ERROR: Server issues (5xx)
- CLIENT_ERROR: Client request issues (4xx)

**Testing needed**:
- Upload on airplane mode → should show "No internet connection"
- Upload on slow cellular → should show "Upload timed out on cellular data. Try WiFi"
- Upload with Blossom server down → should show "Upload server is having issues"
