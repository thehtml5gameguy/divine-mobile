## Project Notes

VineRecordingProvider error handling pattern:
- stopRecording() now gracefully handles draft save failures
- Video file is preserved in RecordingResult even if draft creation fails
- This follows defensive programming - never lose user data
- Similar pattern used in _autoSaveDraftBeforeDispose() at line 235
