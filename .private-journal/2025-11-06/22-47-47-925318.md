## Project Notes

**Android Distribution Blockers Status:**

1. **Advertising ID Declaration** - COMPLETE
   - App does NOT use advertising IDs (verified - no ad SDKs in dependencies)
   - AndroidManifest.xml already has correct declaration (line 43-45): `tools:node="remove"` for AD_ID permission
   - **Action needed:** Fill out the Play Console form declaring we don't use advertising IDs

2. **Child Safety Standards** - IN PROGRESS
   - Social app category requires child safety compliance declaration
   - Need to review Google's child safety policy requirements
   - **Action needed:** Review policy and implement required declarations/compliance

3. **Build Issue** - FIXED
   - integration_test plugin was incorrectly included in release build
   - Fixed with flutter clean + pub get
   - Release build now succeeds (144.4MB AAB generated)
