## Project Notes

## Explore Screen Feed Differentiation Fix

**Problem**: Both "Popular Now" and "Trending" tabs showed identical content because they used the same sorting (loop count descending).

**Solution**: 
- Renamed "Popular Now" → "New Vines" to better reflect purpose
- Changed sorting for New Vines tab to sort by `created_at` timestamp (newest first)
- Kept Trending tab sorting by `originalLoops` (most popular first)

**Changes Made**:
1. Updated tab label: "Popular Now" → "New Vines"
2. Updated analytics tracking: `popular_now` → `new_vines`
3. Changed sorting in `_buildPopularNowTab()`: 
   - OLD: `sortedVideos.sort((a, b) => bLoops.compareTo(aLoops))`
   - NEW: `sortedVideos.sort((a, b) => b.createdAt.compareTo(a.createdAt))`
4. Updated all log messages and analytics events to use "new_vines"

**Result**: Two distinct feeds:
- **New Vines**: Shows freshly posted videos
- **Trending**: Shows most-looped/popular videos
